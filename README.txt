Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) or "sudo apt install npm"

To setup the application (I use bash for all of the scripts):

"cd backend", then run "npm install", to run the backend server, do "npm start" inside the backend folder
"cd frontend", then run "npm install", to run the frontend client, do "ng serve -o" inside the frontend folder

The backend API is hosted on localhost:5000
The frontend client is connected on localhost:4200

All of the relevant data for logins are stored inside backend/src/data.ts
